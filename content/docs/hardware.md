To create a reliable yet compact setup, I've carefully selected the following hardware components:

#### Beelink SER5 Pro Mini PC
- **Processor**: AMD Ryzen 7 5800H (8C/16T, Up to 4.4GHz)
- **RAM**: 32GB DDR4
- **Storage**: 1TB NVMe SSD
- **Graphics**: Integrated AMD Radeon (Supports 4K@60Hz Output)
- **Networking**:
  - **WiFi 6** (Primary connection)
  - **Bluetooth 5.2**
  - **Ethernet via WiFi Extender**
- **Operating System**: Proxmox VE 8.x (Replaces Windows 11 Pro)

#### WiFi Extender (Ethernet Connection)
- Extends network coverage for Proxmox.
- Provides an **Ethernet bridge** for better stability.

#### Cooling System (Optional)
- An external cooling fan or additional thermal management can be used to maintain performance under high loads.

#### Small Rack for Organization (Optional)
- A small rack is used to neatly organize the mini PC and manage cables, ensuring a tidy setup and improved airflow.
