Beelink SER5 Pro Mini PC Processor: AMD Ryzen 7 5800H (8C/16T, Up to 4.4GHz) RAM: 32GB DDR4 Storage: 1TB NVMe SSD Graphics: Integrated AMD Radeon (Supports 4K@60Hz Output) Networking: WiFi 6 (Primary connection) Bluetooth 5.2 Ethernet via WiFi Extender Operating System: Proxmox VE 8.x (Replaces Windows 11 Pro) 2. WiFi Extender (Ethernet Connection) Extends network coverage for Proxmox. Provides an Ethernet bridge for better stability. 3. Cooling System (Optional) An external cooling fan or additional thermal management can be used to maintain performance under high loads. 4. Small Rack for Organization (Optional) A small rack is used to neatly organize the mini PC and manage cables, ensuring a tidy setup and improved airflow. Next Steps Once you have the hardware in place, you can begin installing your chosen hypervisor (e.g., Proxmox), setting up network configurations (pfSense, Tailscale), and organizing your storage solution (TrueNAS).","questions-or-feedback#Questions or Feedback?":" ‚ùì ProxLink is still in active development.
