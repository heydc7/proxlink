Provides virtual bridges (vmbr0, vmbr1, vmbr2) to connect VMs to pfSense and the physical network. Virtual Bridges (vmbr) vmbr0 ‚Äì WAN bridge connected to the router (192.168.1.0/24) vmbr1 ‚Äì LAN bridge for internal VMs (192.168.2.0/24) vmbr2 ‚Äì DMZ bridge for exposed services (192.168.3.0/24) pfSense Firewall (VM) Interfaces: net0 (WAN): Connected to vmbr0 net1 (LAN): Connected to vmbr1 net2 (DMZ): Connected to vmbr2 Handles inter-VLAN routing, NAT, firewall rules, and VPN access. Internal VMs Ubuntu Desktop VM Connected to LAN via vmbr1 Ubuntu Server Connected to DMZ via vmbr2 External Network Router Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1 Provides internet access for the Proxmox host and pfSense WAN interface. External Access Devices on the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet can access the pfSense WAN. Tailscale provides full-tunnel VPN access, enabling remote access to internal services securely over the internet.

Tailscale provides secure, encrypted, and authenticated remote access to internal services across the LAN and DMZ without the complexity of traditional VPNs.\nWhy Tailscale? Tailscale is a mesh VPN built on WireGuard, designed to simplify secure networking across devices and networks. It is ideal for homelabs because:\nZero-config networking over the internet Device-level access control (ACLs) Works through NAT/firewalls Supports full-tunnel VPN routing ProxLink VPN Topology Tailscale is installed directly on the pfSense VM (via a Linux package or Tailscale daemon). pfSense acts as a subnet router and exit node, routing all VPN traffic to internal networks. Remote clients connect to the Tailscale network and gain access to the LAN (192.168.2.0/24) and optionally the DMZ (192.168.3.0/24). "},"title":"VPN Configuration"}}
